## Inforation Description
The Description, Basic Introduction, Full Installation, Usage, Disclaimer and Sources are available on the main folder of the repository. This page will only show the Basic Installation of the
*Installation Only* version of this script.

## Installation
In order to install the VPN service we will have to execute the ***install-vpn.sh*** file with **Super User Priviledges _(sudo)_** using the following command (make sure to be inside the cloned folder):

``sudo bash install-vpn.sh``

It will ask you for your machine password if it is your first time using _sudo_ in that terminal session. After that, press enter and let the installation begin by itself.<br>
Once the installation is completed, the user will be able to execute the connection and disconnection commands.

If any errors ocurred, feel free to open a new issue in the ***Issues*** section of the repository. __Please make sure that there is not another issue similar to yours before creating a new one
so all the same problems can be solved at once.__
